AI-Powered Cinematic Video Script 
Generator 
Summary Report (Output Video - Final Video.mp4 ) 
Overview 
An advanced AI-powered video script generator created for Google VEO3 video generation. 
Provides a complete, systematic, and reusable framework that transforms any feature 
description into cinematic, professional-quality explainer videos. Achieves automation and 
scalability in narrative construction, stakeholder journey mapping, and VEO3-optimized 
script writing. 
System Architecture 
• Language: Python 3.11 
• Core UI: Streamlit 
• Video Assembly: MoviePy 
• Perplexity AI (Free for all Airtel Users): Advanced feature analysis and structured 
information extraction. 
• Google GenAI (VEO 3) Models:  
• veo-3.0-fast-generate-001 (primary) 
• veo-3.0-generate-001 (secondary high-quality) 
• veo-3.0-fast-generate-preview (quick preview) 
• veo-3.0-generate-preview (standard preview) 
• veo-2.0-generate-001 (fallback) 
• JSON & OS Modules: For data management and operational controls. Link - Raw 
Generated Output 
• Quality Assurance: Integrated QA framework ensures output consistency and 
reliability.  Link - QA Report 
• Logging/Timing: Uses built-in modules to track processes for traceability. (Link 
Logs, ChunkScripts , Master Prompt ) 
Key Components: 
1) Enhanced Feature Analysis Engine: Universal engine for processing 
features across industries and types. 
2) Feature Description Parser: Uses advanced AI prompting to parse and 
extract structured data (capabilities, user journeys) from unstructured feature 
descriptions. 
3) Stakeholder Journey Mapping: Visual/algorithmic mapping of how features 
impact different user groups. 
4) Script Generator: Produces narrative scripts optimized for VEO3 ingestion 
and cinematic quality. 
 
Design Choices 
• Python 3.11: Modern features and extensive AI libraries vs. older versions or others. 
• Streamlit: Rapid UI development vs. complex frameworks like Flask/Django. 
• MoviePy: Python-native video editing vs. heavy multimedia APIs like Adobe. 
• Dual AI (Perplexity + GenAI): Combined analysis + generation strengths vs. single
model limitations. 
Conclusion 
This system sets a new standard for AI-driven video script generation, combining cutting
edge AI models, robust architecture, and industry-leading automation to deliver high-quality 
cinematic explainer videos at scale.
